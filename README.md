### [Ask a question][ask-a-question] &nbsp; | &nbsp; [Read answered questions][read-answered-questions]


I get a lot of questions by social media and email but responding to an email only helps one person. This way anyone can read the answer.

**If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an [email][gmail-email] and I can post the question anonymously for you.

Subscribe for updates by [watching the repo][repo-subscription].

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.


### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :).
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

> Note: Can ask in Arabic or English or French !


#### Other contact mediums

I can also be reached on [Instagram][my-instagram], [Twitter][my-twitter] and [email][gmail-email], but I prefer [this medium][ask-a-question].
